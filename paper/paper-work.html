                        Do you know from what English people get their family names? Finish the sentences after you read
                        the story. Everyone has a family name. But what does it mean? From what do family names come?
                        First, some family names come from the place of their homes. If a man lives on or near a hill,
                        his family name may be Hill. In England people’s names may be Wood, Lake, because they live near
                        the wood or lake. Second, family names come from a person’s job. If a person is a cook, he may
                        be Cook. Third, many people get their family names from their father’s given name. If you hear
                        the name “Jackson”, you know that he is the son of Jack. 1. English people usually have
                        ___________ ways to get their family names. 2. Some people get their family names from
                        _______________________________. 3. Some people get their family names
                        from________________________________. 4. Some people get their family names
                        from__________________________________. 5. A person’s family name is Jackson, because he
                        is_______________________.
